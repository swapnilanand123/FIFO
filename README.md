# FIFO
The "FIFO Basic Operation" test case is designed to verify the fundamental functionality of a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) memory. The test steps cover initialization, data writing, verification of data writing order, data reading, verification of data reading order, and testing boundary conditions such as overflow and underflow scenarios.
